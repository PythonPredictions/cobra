    "\n",
    "1. Use the notebook to prototype and test drive your development\n",
    "2. Migrate your developed code into the project. Create a python file, organize it in classes,...\n",
    "3. Document your migrated code (docstring) so it's functionality is documented in the sphinx docs.\n",
    "4. Import the migrated code back into this notebook and develop tests around it.\n",
    "5. Include these tests in the project.\n",
    "6. Cleanup your notebook as the functionality is now in the python project and can be easily imported in the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "The 2 cells below will setup this autoreload functionality (so the original import is not cached) and add the project path to the system path. Now the project source can be imported (without installing it as a python package)."
